Semiprivate
===========

A semiprivate-key encryption system system based on RbNaCl. Traditionally there
are symmetric key systems which use only one key, and asymmetric key systems
(also known as "public key systems") which use two keys. Semiprivate key systems
allow for the creation of an unlimited number of subordinate keys from a given
master key.
